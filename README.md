# Graph Coloring with Grover's Algorithm: Optimizing Time and Space Efficiencies
Graph coloring, a NP-complete problem that involves assigning colors to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, is computationally intensive for traditional recursive approaches. However, advances in quantum computing show promise for reducing the search time complexity by offering a quadratic speedup over classical brute-force strategies. This project leverages Grover's algorithm, a quantum search method, to solve the graph coloring problem on a map of the 50 states while comparing time and space efficiencies between various programming languages like Python (Qiskit) and Q#.
